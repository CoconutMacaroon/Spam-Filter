# Spam Filter
This Python 3 code detects and filters spam. The email in question goes into the `static/Email.txt` file, and then when the program is ran, it prints whether or not it thinks the email is spam.
# Future
* Email program intigration
* Better documentation
# Files
The `Email.txt` and the `Spam.txt` are both in the `static` folder. The file that acctually does the processing and gives the result is `main.py` and is in the home folder.
